# Snake-Water-Gun Game
 A simple console-based game where the player competes against the computer. The rules are similar to Rock Paper Scissors:  Snake drinks water. Water extinguishes the gun. Gun kills the snake. The player selects one of the three options, and the computer picks randomly. The winner is determined based on these rules.
